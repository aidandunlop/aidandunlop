This is my first post on this site - just to get things rolling.

I'll be updating this site with projects I'm working on and anything I find particularly interesting that I can bore you people with. It will mostly be about Artificial Intelligence, Software Development and other weird, geeky things.

A little bit about me: I've done front end development for the last few years, but I'm currently looking to move into the Machine Learning world. Having studied Computer Science at university, I studied elements of Artificial Intelligence and found it incredibly interesting. My third year project was a Computer Vision based tracking problem, where I attempted to detect and identify football players in low quality video. I've recently completed Springboard's Machine Learning Engineering track, where I learnt more about Machine Learning in the real world and expanded my skills as an ML practitioner. 

To finish, let me recommend [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as an awesome tool for building static websites. If you're familiar with React and want to start building super fast websites with ease, Gatsby is a great option. Here's some links to get you started:

- [Is Gatsby really that great?](https://blog.logrocket.com/is-gatsby-really-that-great-e7b19c4c1c05/)
- [Gatsby starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2) is a great collection of ready to go templates to get you started. Some feature one-click [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) deployment, which is a joy to use.
- [Gatsby tutorials](https://www.gatsbytutorials.com/) is a community driven list of Gatsby tutorials
