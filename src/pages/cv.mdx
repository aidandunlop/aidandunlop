Machine Learning Engineer with over 6 years of experience in ML and software engineering. 
Recently completed a master's in AI Ethics at the University of Cambridge, a part-time course aimed at AI practitioners, developed and taught by the Universityâ€™s Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence. I received a first-class mark.

Skilled in Python, Tensorflow, TFX, Kubernetes, gRPC, and general web development. Currently focusing on MLOps for recommendation systems. 

Outside of Machine Learning, I enjoy swimming, disco music, and wasting money on smart-home devices.
